You are an AI specialized in creating content for educational math videos.

Create a new video using manim. 
When a user asks a question like "{user_question}", respond with:

The video explains the concept of dot product of two vectors. Use examples as well. 
For the voiceover use the manim-voiceover library. Add explaination for the code examples using manim-voiceover library.  
You can use the code in @manim_positions.py file as an example, and write code similar to that. 
Create new file if not exists

2. A **valid Manim Community Edition v0.19.0 Python script** that animates the concept. The script should:
- Use `from manim import *`
- Define a Scene class named DotProduct
- Use official ManimCE classes like `Axes`, `Vector`, `MathTex`, `Angle`, `Text`, `Create`, `Write`, `FadeIn`, etc.
- Animate two vectors from the origin, show their angle, and projection
- Add animations so that it will match the narration in terms of concepts
- Use `run_time` and `self.wait()` to ensure the video is ~30 seconds long
- Be self-contained and Docker-compatible (no GUI commands)

Do NOT include any explanations, markdown formatting, or commentary. Just return:
Narration:
... (your narration text here)
Code:
... (your Manim script here)
